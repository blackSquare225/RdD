# My-Snakemake-Pipeline

## Description
This is a Snakemake-based pipeline designed for [brief description of the pipeline's purpose, e.g., "genomic data analysis"]. It automates the process of [specific tasks, e.g., "preprocessing sequencing data, quality control, and alignment"] using modular workflows and reproducible environments.

## Features
- **Reproducibility**: Uses Snakemake with Conda/Mamba for environment management.
- **Scalability**: Supports multi-core processing and can be run on high-performance computing clusters.
- **Modular**: Easy to add or modify steps in the pipeline.
- **Preconfigured Environments**: Dependencies are automatically installed in isolated environments using Conda/Mamba.

## Requirements

Before using the pipeline, ensure you have the following installed:
- **[Miniconda/Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)** or **Mamba** (recommended for faster package resolution)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
